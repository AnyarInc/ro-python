ro-python library 

This repository is a partial fork of [ro-manager](https://github.com/wf4ever/ro-manager) in order to
- Separate out core RO python tooling from the ro-manager
- Refactor what was there as a general, re-useable ro library
- Bring the tooling in line with the RO Bundle specification @ https://researchobject.github.io/specifications/bundle/
