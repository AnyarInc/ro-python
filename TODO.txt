Priorities from Kristina:

I think such a tool would form a great starting point! As a start I would be happy with the following (by order of importance):

    * ro config: configure research object management tool
    * ro create: create new research object
    * ro add: add files to a research object
    * ro ls: list contents of research object
    * ro annotate, ro annotations: annotate research object contents
    * ro users: sharing research objects

which corresponds very well with your proposal of which functions to tackle initially. The only thing I miss is the sharing part. I think that is something I would like to be able to do quite fast as well. One thing I thought about was logging. Would it be possible to create a log? That would help me backtrack what I actually do with a RO, and in which order I tend to do things.
